Hi, I'm July, and today I'm going to explain a section of LIBGDX called HANDLING INPUT MULTIPLEXATING CONTROLLERS


MULTIPLEXING
Multiplexing is the generic term
used to describe the operation of
sending one or more analogue or
digital signals over a common
transmission line at different
times or speeds.

INPUTPROCESSOR
An InputProcessor is used to receive input events from the
keyboard and the touch screen (mouse on the desktop).

INPUTMULTIPLEXER
The InputMultiplexer will hand any new events to the first
InputProcessor that was added to it. If that processor returns
false from the method invoked to handle the event, this
indicates the event was not handled and the multiplexer will
hand the event to the next processor in the chain.

BUT HOW DOES INPUTPROCESSOR WORK?
You must create a class that implements InputProcessor, which will implement
these methods that control the entries of different kinds.

BUT HOW DOES INPUTMULTIPLEXER WORK?
In the class that implements ApplicationListener, we will create
the InputMultiplexer and add the InputProcessor that we
want, as if it were a list. The InputMultiplexer will go through
the InputProcessor until some event returns true, then it will
stop its search.

WHAT PURPOSE DOES IT HAVE?
It can be used, for example, in first-person shooter games, to separate the use of the
keyboard and the mouse in different InputProcessors. So to be able to handle the
movement of the character, as well as move the camera of it.

you need to create a class that implements InputProcessor, this will be passed the GameScreen class to access its method that moves the Snake object.
We will implement the overwrite methods, we will return false in all those we will use in the keyboard, for example, KeyDown.
In the SCROLLED method, we will apply the changes. if a one is entered, we will scroll down,else is one negative, up. And we will use the updateDirection method of the GameScreen class for move the Snake.

We will do the same on the keyboard, but using the KeyDown method

We will create an InputMultiplexer object that will be responsible for reading as many InputProcessor as we want to add it.

We add a keyboard and a mouse, the keyboard will use it to move from left to right, and the mouse wheel to move from top to bottom.

and we add the InputMultiplexer to the input of GDX.

Ahora probamos el Juego.


This is all thanks you!.
